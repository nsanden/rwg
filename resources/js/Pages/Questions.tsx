They work well as conversation starters where everyone in the group answers the question, or they can be used as a way to get to know people better since many of the questions ask about personal experiences and opinions. They can also be used to create more elaborate games where people have to guess who would answer a specific question in a certain way.</p>

                        <p>That's exactly why this free random question generator was created. Rather than trying to think up random questions to ask on your own, this generator gives you a large variety of random questions that can be used for any purpose you can imagine.</p>

                        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Do you include common questions?</h3>
                        <p>We've purposely attempted to stay away from questions that are commonly asked. We wanted this generator to give you questions that you most likely have never seen or heard before so that you receive a truly random question that's unique and interesting.</p>

                        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Can I use this for 21 questions?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, this random question generator can be excellent to use if you want to play 21 questions or any other game that requires questions. While the generator gives you far more than 21 questions, you can simply use the first 21 questions generated, or generate new random questions until you have 21 questions you like for your game.</p>

                        <p>The random questions generated are meant to be applicable for both girls and boys. We don't generate questions that are specifically for one gender or the other. The questions should be interesting and thought-provoking for everyone regardless of gender.</p>
