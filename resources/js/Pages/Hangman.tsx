            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 text-gray-800">How to Play Hangman</h2>

            <p>
                Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that's perfect for players of all ages. One player thinks of a word and draws a series of dashes representing each letter. The other player guesses letters one at a time. If the letter is in the word, it's filled in wherever it appears. If not, a part of a stick figure is drawn. The goal is to guess the word before the drawing is completed.
