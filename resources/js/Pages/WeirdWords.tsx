            <p>
                You likely made it to the website because you were searching for a <Link
                    href="/" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700">random word generator</Link> which our
                main page
                tool does an excellent job of doing.
                As would be expected, the main tool produces more common words used on a regular basis by most people.
                But what if you want to find weird English words? That's exactly why we created the Random Unusual
                Word Generator.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're looking for words that are part of the English language, but you may have never heard used in
                conversation before, this is the online tool you've been looking for. It has hundreds of odd, unusual,
                weird, funny, and just plain entertaining words that you'll never likely use in a normal conversation,
                but are definitely fun to know. When you think, "I would like to learn a new word today" in your mind,
                the words in this generator are exactly the type you're thinking of. Since these words are uncommon, the
                definition of each word is also included in the results so you know exactly what each word means. Below
                you'll find a number of ways this online tool can be used.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 text-gray-800">Fun</h2>
            <p>
                Seriously, this is a fun generator to just enjoy with no other purpose in mind. There are a lot of
                people who just happen across this free tool, but once they find it, spend much more time than they
                anticipated generating unusual random words again and again. Time may fly by as you play with this tool.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 text-gray-800">New Word of the Day</h2>
            <p>
                If you're the type of person who loves to learn a new word a day, this may be the perfect tool for you
                to visit each morning. Since the words in the generator are fun and quirky, it's actually a lot of fun
                (and not a chore) learning that new word a day. In fact, they're the type of words that you're likely to
                share with your friends or try to use in a conversation just to see the surprised looks on all the other
                people's faces when you use it.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 text-gray-800">Expand Your Vocabulary</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond learning a new word a day, this tool is an excellent way to expand your vocabulary in an easy,
                interesting way. While going through vocabulary lists can take a lot of time and at times be quite
                boring, you're guaranteed to have some unusual word pop up with every click which can make it a lot of
                fun. Improving your vocabulary doesn't need to be a drag.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 text-gray-800">Guessing Game</h2>
            <p>
                This generator can also provide a lot of fun when you're with friends. All you need to do is generate a
                random unusual word and then let your friends try and guess the meaning of it. Again, this is a great
                way to group learn new vocabulary in a nontraditional study method. The guesses of what the words mean
                can often be as entertaining as the unusual words themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Above are just a few ways this tool can be used. If you happen to use this generator on a fairly regular
                basis or are using it for a specific project, we would appreciate you taking a moment to let us know
                exactly how you're using it. While we usually have a general idea of how the tools we create will be
                used, we're often surprised at some of the creative ways they end up being used we never anticipated. By
                understanding the various ways it's being used gives us the opportunity to make improvements to it as we
                update, ultimately making it better for everyone. In addition, if you have a specific suggestion on how
                we could improve the Random Unusual Word Generator, we'd love to get your ideas.
